# XML for Tiddlywiki

This plugin provides several tools which allow for manipulating and parsing XML tiddlers.

* Provides widgets which allow iterating through your documents using XPath.
* Provides importing and exporting tiddlers in XML
* Allows rendering of XML tiddlers, as well as the ability to directly render XML files using templates instead of showing their raw data.

This plugin is a work in progress. It's not ready to be used yet.
